[ Microsoft-HTTPAPI ]
	The HTTP Server API enables applications to communicate 
	over HTTP without using Microsoft Internet Information 
	Server (IIS). Applications can register to receive HTTP 
	requests for particular URLs, receive HTTP requests, and 
	send HTTP responses. The HTTP Server API includes SSL 
	support so that applications can exchange data over secure 
	HTTP connections without IIS. It is also designed to work 
	with I/O completion ports.
