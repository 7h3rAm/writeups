          We get a shell with `www-data` privileges and use it to probe further. From the listing of open ports, we find that the ssh port `22/tcp` is open and accepting connection only on the localhost interface. We can use `socat` to tunnel this port to probe it from our attacking system:
        command: |
          socat tcp-listen:1337,reuseaddr,fork tcp:localhost:22

          With this, we now have tunneled `localhost:22` to `10.10.41.240:1337` and can now run a ssh password bruteforce for user `fox` on it. After a few minutes we find a hit and can now login:
        command: |
          hydra -l fox -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.41.240:1337

          We find that we can execute the `/usr/sbin/shutdown` file with `sudo`. Since the target machine doesn't have `strings` installed, we transfer this file to our attacking machine and investigate further. We find a reference to the `poweroff` binary name, which when combined with the fact that `secure_path` is not defined within `/etc/sudoers` (seen in `sudo -l` output), hint that a environment path modification vector could help us escalate privileges:

          We copy bash to the local directory, rename it to `poweroff` and modify the `PATH` environment variable to search for file within current directory first. With this change, we then execute `shutdown` file and get elevated privileges:
        command: |
          cp /bin/bash ./
          mv ./bash poweroff
          ls -la poweroff /bin/bash

          We see the third flag file `root.txt` but it turns out to be placeholder. After some searching, we find the actual root flag file `.did-you-think-I-was-useless.root`, hidden within user `rascal`'s home directory:
        command: |
          cat /home/rascal/.did-you-think-I-was-useless.root

    flags:

      - "/home/rascal/.did-you-think-I-was-useless.root: THM{ODM3NTdkMDljYmM4ZjdhZWFhY2VjY2Fk}"
  learning:
    - The webapp exposed a search field which was vulnerable to command injection. This allowed the attacker to gain interactive access of the target machine. It is advised to follow a secure development lifecycle for critical production web applications.
    - The `shutdown` binary was vulnerable to a path expansion attack which allowed the attacker to gain elevated privileges.
