Eric's wifi

Hey VV,

It's your boy Billy here.  Sorry to leave in the middle of the night but I wanted to crack Eric's wireless and then mess with him.
I wasn't completely successful yet, but at least I got a start.

I didn't walk away without doing my signature move, though.  I left a flaming bag of dog poo on his doorstep. :-)

Kisses,

Billy
