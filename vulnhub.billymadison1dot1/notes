Ugh, this is frustrating.  

I managed to make a system account for myself. I also managed to hide Billy's paper
where he'll never find it.  However, now I can't find it either :-(. 
To make matters worse, my privesc exploits aren't working.  
One sort of worked, but I think I have it installed all backwards.

If I'm going to maintain total control of Billy's miserable life (or what's left of it) 
I need to root the box and find that paper!

Fortunately, my SSH backdoor into the system IS working.  
All I need to do is send an email that includes
the text: "My kid will be a ________ _________"

The new secret port will be open and then I can login from there with my wifi password, which I'm
sure Billy or Veronica know.  I didn't see it in Billy's FTP folders, but didn't have time to
check Veronica's.
