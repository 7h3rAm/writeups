  This page is used to test the proper operation of the Apache Web server after
  it has been installed.  If you can read this page, it means that the Apache
  Web server installed at this site is working properly.

  <P>
  You may now add content to this directory, and replace this page.  Note that
  until you do so, people visiting your website will see this page, and not your
  content.
  </P>

  <P>If you have upgraded from Red Hat Linux 6.2 and earlier, then you are
  seeing this page because the default <A
  href="manual/mod/core.html#documentroot"><STRONG>DocumentRoot</STRONG></A>
  set in <TT>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</TT> has changed.  Any subdirectories
  which existed under <TT>/home/httpd</TT> should now be moved to
  <TT>/var/www</TT>.  Alternatively, the contents of <TT>/var/www</TT> can be
  moved to <TT>/home/httpd</TT>, and the configuration file can be updated
  accordingly.

  <P>
  The fact that you are seeing this page indicates that the website you just
  visited is either experiencing problems, or is undergoing routine maintenance.
  </P>

  <P>
  If you would like to let the administrators of this website know that you've
  seen this page instead of the page you expected, you should send them e-mail.
  In general, mail sent to the name "webmaster" and directed to the website's
  domain should reach the appropriate person.

  <P>
  For example, if you experienced problems while visiting www.example.com,
  you should send e-mail to "webmaster@example.com".
