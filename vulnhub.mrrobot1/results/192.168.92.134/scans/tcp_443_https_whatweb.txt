Detected Plugins:
[ Apache ]
	The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and 
	maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating 
	systems including UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this 
	project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible 
	server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current 
	HTTP standards.

	Website     : http://httpd.apache.org/

[ HTML5 ]
	HTML version 5, detected by the doctype declaration 


[ HTTPServer ]
	HTTP server header string. This plugin also attempts to 
	identify the operating system from the server header. 

	String       : Apache (from server string)

[ Script ]
	This plugin detects instances of script HTML elements and 
	returns the script language/type. 


[ UncommonHeaders ]
	Uncommon HTTP server headers. The blacklist includes all 
	the standard headers and many non standard but common ones. 
	Interesting but fairly common headers should have their own 
	plugins, eg. x-powered-by, server and x-aspnet-version. 
	Info about headers can be found at www.http-stats.com 

	String       : x-mod-pagespeed (from headers)

[ X-Frame-Options ]

	HTTP header. - More Info:
